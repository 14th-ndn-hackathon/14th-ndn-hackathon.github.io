We are hosting a two-day NDN Hackathon (March 4-5, 2023). The event is open and free to participate in
and winners will receive exciting prizes! This event targets all levels of participants and,
particularly for beginners, will be an excellent opportunity to get started with NDN.

This year we are encouraging people to take a look at the [7 exciting categories]({% link hacks.md %})

participants who wish to work on them!

We particularly encourage projects that:

- Create or improve documentation and how-to guides.
